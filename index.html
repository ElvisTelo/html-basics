    <div class="card">The HyperText Markup Language, 
      or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
      It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
      and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</div>
    <div class="card">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
      and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
      originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</div>
    <div class="card">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
      With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded 
      into the rendered page.</div>
    <div class="card">HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
      for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</div>
    <div class="card">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, 
      which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
      Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</div>
    <div class="card"> A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, 
      primarily using the canvas element, in collaboration with javascript.</div>
